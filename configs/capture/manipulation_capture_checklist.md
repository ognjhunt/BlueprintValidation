# Manipulation Capture Checklist

Use this checklist when scanning a facility if your target policies include pick/place tasks.

## Required

- Capture at robot-eye height (`~1.0m-1.4m`) for all aisles where manipulation happens.
- Record close-range passes (`0.5m-1.5m`) around each manipulation zone:
  - floor pallets
  - tote staging areas
  - shelf pick faces
  - bin transfer stations
- Capture both approach and retreat paths for each zone.
- Include at least 2 lighting conditions (for example: normal shift + dim/off-angle lights).

## Strongly Recommended

- Scan the same zone with multiple object layouts:
  - tote present
  - tote absent
  - cluttered nearby pallet
- Include partial occlusions (forklift parked, carton stack, worker traffic if safe).
- Keep motion smooth and slow to reduce blur and improve reconstruction quality.

## Minimum Coverage Target

- 3-5 close-up clips per manipulation zone.
- 10+ seconds of footage per zone from two headings.
- At least one complete sweep that connects all manipulation zones.
